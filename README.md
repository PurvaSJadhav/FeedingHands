🥗 FeedingHands - Digital Platform for Food Redistribution

🌍 Problem Statement

Every day, nearly 3000 children die due to hunger while over 20 crore Indians go to sleep on an empty stomach. Meanwhile, 40% of food produced in India is wasted, amounting to 67 million tonnes annually. This massive food wastage also contributes to environmental issues like excessive water consumption and pollution.

FeedingHands aims to bridge this gap by creating a digital platform that connects surplus food sources with NGOs and individuals in need, enabling real-time redistribution and waste reduction.
